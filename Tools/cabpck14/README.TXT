CabPack is a compression program with which you can create cabinet
(.CAB) files.  With just a few mouse clicks you specify which files to
compress, which compression method to use, where the output files
should go and whether or not the cabinet files should span multiple
disks.  CabPack is able to store subdirectories, and depending on the
platform you wish to extract the cabinets on, it can create .CAB files
that contain long filenames or store these long filenames in the
8.3 format.  New in v1.4: the ability to create spanned CABs directly
on disk drives.  English and German version included.  Read the .DOCs
for more detail.

I have tested CabPack with Windows 95, 98, and NT 4.

This program is freeware. Please distribute freely.
